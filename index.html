    of climate change </p>
  <p>Climate change refers to significant and long-term shifts in Earth's weather patterns and temperatures, mainly
    caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. This leads to
    global
    warming, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and other environmental disruptions.</p>

  <h2>What can we do?</h2>
  <img src="" />
  <h4>Here are some steps you can take to help: </h4>

  <ul>
    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Reuse, Reduce, Recycle
      <ul>
        <li>The things we buy, like electronics, clothes, and plastics, create pollution at every step of their
          production, from getting the raw materials to making and shipping them. To help the environment, try to
          buy
          less stuff, consider buying used items, and fix things when they break instead of replacing them.
          Plastics,
          for example, create a lot of pollution. In 2019, they caused 1.8 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions,
          which is bad for the climate. Most plastic isn't recycled, so it sticks around for a long time after we
          throw it away. Buying fewer new clothes and other stuff can also help cut down on pollution. For every
          kilogram of clothes made, about 17 kilograms of carbon dioxide are released into the air. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Clean Up
      <ul>
        <li>When we don't throw away our garbage properly, it can harm people, animals, and plants by polluting the
          land and water. Use only what you need, and when you're done with something, make sure to throw it away in
          the right place. Encourage others to do the same, and join efforts to clean up parks, rivers, beaches, and
          other areas. Every year, humans throw away a huge amount of trash - about 2 billion tons. A third of this
          trash causes environmental problems like polluting water and poisoning soil.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Speak Up
      <ul>
        <li>To help protect our planet, let's speak up about the changes we want to see. Encourage everyone in our
          community and household to make cleaner and more environmentally friendly choices. We can start by
          reducing
          waste, conserving energy, using reusable items, and supporting eco-friendly practices. Together, we can
          make a
          positive impact on the health of our planet for future generations.</li>
      </ul>
